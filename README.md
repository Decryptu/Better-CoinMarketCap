# Better CoinMarketCap Extension

Enhance your CoinMarketCap experience with "Better CoinMarketCap," a Chrome extension that simplifies and improves the website's interface by removing ads, community sections filled with scams, and other unnecessary elements. The latest update introduces a "Market Overview" card, replacing the problematic "Community" section with valuable insights into the total market cap, 24h volume, and BTC/ETH dominance.

## Features

- **Clean Interface:** Experience CoinMarketCap without the clutter of community sections and ads.
- **Market Overview Card:** Get a quick and informative overview of the market with the total market cap, 24h trading volume, and BTC/ETH dominance, directly on the homepage. This feature replaces the previous "Community" section that was prone to scams and viruses, ensuring a safer browsing experience.
- **Market Cap to Volume Ratio:** Calculate and display the market cap to volume ratio for each cryptocurrency, with a color indicator to quickly identify if a crypto's market cap is inflated or if its volume is too low compared to its market cap. This feature helps in finding cryptocurrencies that may have an inflated market cap, providing a valuable tool for better investment decisions.
- **Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV):** Introduces the calculation and display of the Fully Diluted Valuation for each cryptocurrency, alongside the market cap in the listings. The FDV is color-coded based on the ratio of market cap to FDV - green for ratios between 0-10%, yellow for 10-50%, and red for ratios over 50%, providing an additional layer of insight for investment decisions. Infinite supplies are marked with an "âˆž" symbol, without color coding.
- **Dynamic Theme Support:** Automatically adjusts the styling of added elements (such as FDV and ratio indicators) to match CoinMarketCap's day and night themes for seamless integration.
- **Modern Design:** Enjoy a modernized and intuitive design for easier navigation.
- **Open Source:** Full transparency with an open-source codebase on GitHub.
